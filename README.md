# SplunkGarbage
Dump of Splunk search strings and code that I think I might use in the future. If anyone can figure out my ramblings of comments and can use this mess more power to them


This Project was built out by using my searches and reports that I built from my position at a credit union. 
All revealing data has been removed to the best of my knowlege but if some is found please let me know

Feel free to message me on twitter for any questions about the code in this repo and feel free to use any of it for whatever
